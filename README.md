## Installation

Navigate to the project directory and use 'npm i' in your terminal to install

## Usage

Type 'node index.js' in your terminal to start the prompts and answer the prompts as they appear. The text prompt will only accept strings of up to 3 letters. When prompted for a color and inputting a hexadecimal code, please be sure to include '#' before the hexadecimal code. Once the prompts are completed, the SVG file will be written into the examples folder.

## Contributing

How to contribute to this project:

A way to automatically include the '#' when entering a hexadecimal code if it doesn't already include it, an error that will display when entering an invalid input in any of the prompts and prompt the user for the input again

## Tests

Testing suites were created for generating the correct shape for the SVG and for generating the correct text to embed inside the SVG shape. All tests were successful when testing with Jest
